Getting Startedâ€¦
It was a challenging journey for me and all my team members as we have to complete it within the time of construct week, so we faced different challenges like it was our first project and we did not have any experience working in a team also we did not know how to manage everything within the time period. So we started with planning and studying the website, then we distributed the workflow, the roles, and responsibilities and with great collaboration, we managed the work.
Project Details -

We had to make a replica of the Tata 1mg website.
Tata 1mg, previously 1mg, is a healthcare platform based in Gurgaon, India. It provides services, including e-pharmacy, diagnostics, e-consultation and health content. It was founded in April 2015 by Prashant Tandon, Gaurav Agarwal and Vikas Chauhan.
We have tried our best to clone the replica of the website.
